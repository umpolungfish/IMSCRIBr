## Conceptual Framework

The Imscribing Grammar posits that **the boundaries of what can be formally expressed are themselves formally expressible**. IMSCRIBr makes this concrete: the space of possible token arrangements IS the space of possible formal expressions — and it is **finite, enumerable, and now mapped**.

Every length-8 arrangement of the 12 tokens is a candidate *structural type declaration* — a complete sentence in the grammar's combinatorial language. The 12 canonical classes are the most semantically interpretable sentences: bootstrap, genesis, anchor, cycle, record, truth machine, eternal return. The remaining 99.99% of the space is the *background* — the millions of other structural classes that exist but lack a named interpretation.

The key insight is **structural collapse under signature algebra**. Naively, 12⁸ = 430M is enormous. But when arrangements are grouped by:

- **Family signature** — how many tokens come from each algebraic family
- **Structural fingerprint** — topology, self-reference, Frobenius order, periodicities

…the space collapses dramatically. There are only 165 family signatures and ~1,000–2,000 coarse structural classes. The 12 canonical classes occupy the sparse, structured, low-entropy region of this space — they are structural **outliers**, not typical arrangements.

---

## The 12 Tokens

Each token belongs to one of 4 algebraic families. The families are not decorative — they encode distinct structural roles in the grammar:

### Logical Family (6 tokens)

The **category-theoretic skeleton**. These tokens define objects (initial, terminal), morphisms (forward, reverse), composition (linking), and identity — the minimal structure for a category.

| Token | Index | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `VINIT` | 0 | Initial object — the void, the ungenerated source |
| `TANCH` | 1 | Terminal object — the boundary, the final sink |
| `AFWD` | 2 | Forward morphism — directed arrow |
| `AREV` | 3 | Reverse morphism — inverse arrow |
| `CLINK` | 4 | Composition — linking morphisms end-to-end |
| `IMSCRIB` | 5 | Identity morphism — self-imscription, self-reference |

### Frobenius Family (2 tokens)

The **μ∘δ=id algebra**. These two tokens form the Frobenius condition: a split followed by a fuse restores the original object. This is the structural mechanism for *verification* — any system that contains a Frobenius pair in split→fuse order is Frobenius-closed.

| Token | Index | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `FSPLIT` | 6 | Split (δ) — decompose, analyze, differentiate |
| `FFUSE` | 7 | Fuse (μ) — recompose, synthesize, integrate |

### Dialetheia Family (3 tokens)

The **Belnap FOUR lattice**. These three tokens encode truth-value evaluation: true, false, and the capacity to recognize paradox (both true *and* false). A system with all three Dialetheia tokens is *dialetheia-complete* — capable of handling contradiction without collapse.

| Token | Index | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `EVALT` | 8 | Evaluate-true — assertion, confirmation |
| `EVALF` | 9 | Evaluate-false — negation, refutation |
| `ENGAGR` | 10 | Engage paradox — recognize and hold contradiction |

### Linear Family (1 token)

The **irreversible fixation** operator. A single token that marks an irreversible commitment — once placed, the structure cannot be unwound. Analogous to the `!` exponential in linear logic.

| Token | Index | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `IFIX` | 11 | Irreversible fixation — commit, record, make permanent |

### Family Summary

| Family | Count | Tokens | Algebraic Role |
|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Logical | 6 | VINIT, TANCH, AFWD, AREV, CLINK, IMSCRIB | Category skeleton |
| Frobenius | 2 | FSPLIT, FFUSE | μ∘δ=id verification |
| Dialetheia | 3 | EVALT, EVALF, ENGAGR | Belnap FOUR truth lattice |
| Linear | 1 | IFIX | Irreversible fixation (!) |

---

## Arrangement Space

An **arrangement** is a tuple of 8 token indices — one token per position. Position 0 is the *start*, position 7 is the *end*.

```
Position:  0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7
Example:   VINIT → AFWD → FSPLIT → EVALT → FFUSE → EVALF → IFIX → IMSCRIB
```

### Combinatorics

- **Token choices per position:** 12
- **Total arrangements:** 12⁸ = **429,981,696**
- **Variable-length (1–8):** ~469M total
- **Family signatures (length 8):** 165 distinct (L, F, D, X) 4-tuples

The space is too large for naive enumeration at interactive speeds. IMSCRIBr solves this by **signature-decomposed iteration**: for each family signature, it generates only the arrangements that match that signature's family distribution.

### Position 0 Anchor Convention

All 12 canonical arrangements use *different conventions* for Position 0:
- Some anchor on `IMSCRIB` (identity — self-referential bootstrap)
- Some anchor on `VINIT` (void — creation ex nihilo)
- Some anchor on `IFIX` (fixation — pure recording)
- Some anchor on `TANCH` (boundary — anchor protocol)

There is no single universal Position 0 anchor — the anchor is part of what distinguishes the classes.

### Signature Decomposition

The core mathematical insight: instead of iterating 12⁸ = 430M arrangements directly, decompose by **family signature** — a 4-tuple (L, F, D, X) counting how many tokens come from each family. There are only 165 such signatures for length 8.

For a signature (l, f, d, x) with l+f+d+x = 8:

1. **Position assignment:** Choose which positions get which family
   - Count: multinomial(8; l, f, d, x) = 8! / (l! · f! · d! · x!)
2. **Token fill:** For each family's assigned positions, choose specific tokens
   - Logical positions: 6^l choices
   - Frobenius positions: 2^f choices
   - Dialetheia positions: 3^d choices
   - Linear positions: 1^x = 1 choice

**Total for the signature:** multinomial × 6^l × 2^f × 3^d × 1^x

This decomposition turns one 430M-iteration loop into 165 independent sub-loops, each fully enumerable and independently parallelizable.

## The 12 Canonical Classes

Every arrangement reduces via its coarse structural key to one of 12 canonical archetypes. These are the *structurally distinct* reference points in the space — the ones with clear operational semantics.

### I. Dialetheic Bootstrap — *The Self-Referential Paradox Engine*

```
IMSCRIB → EVALT → FSPLIT → EVALF → FFUSE → ENGAGR → IFIX → IMSCRIB
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (2, 2, 3, 1) |
| Start/End | IMSCRIB → IMSCRIB (self-ref) |
| Frobenius | FSPLIT → FFUSE (canonical order) |
| Dialetheia | Complete (all 3) |
| Coarse class size | 360 arrangements |

The **O₂ bootstrap**: self-referential, Frobenius-closed, dialetheia-complete. Begins and ends with identity — the structure that imscribes itself. Contains the full Frobenius path (split→fuse) and all three truth values. Ends with IFIX before closing — the bootstrap process produces irreversible output.

### II. Void Genesis — *Creation Ex Nihilo*

```
VINIT → TANCH → AFWD → FSPLIT → CLINK → FFUSE → IFIX → IMSCRIB
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (5, 2, 0, 1) |
| Start/End | VINIT → IMSCRIB |
| Frobenius | FSPLIT → FFUSE (canonical order) |
| Dialetheia | None |
| Coarse class size | 1,440 arrangements |

**O₀ genesis**: begins at the void (VINIT), constructs a category skeleton (TANCH, AFWD, CLINK), applies the Frobenius pair to verify the construction, fixes the result (IFIX), and terminates at identity (IMSCRIB). A complete creation sequence — from nothing to self-consistent structure.

### III. Anchor Protocol — *The Period-3 Sabbath Cycle*

```
TANCH → AREV → VINIT → AFWD → TANCH → CLINK → IFIX → IMSCRIB
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (7, 0, 0, 1) |
| Start/End | TANCH → IMSCRIB |
| Frobenius | None |
| Dialetheia | None |
| Coarse class size | 5,100 arrangements |

**O₁ cycle**: period-3 anchored at the boundary (TANCH). The anchor protocol establishes a repeating cycle of departure (AREV), return to void (VINIT), and forward motion (AFWD) before closing at the boundary again. Mixed with composition (CLINK), fixation (IFIX), and identity (IMSCRIB). A structural sabbath — rhythm without Frobenius verification.

### IV. Dual Bootstrap — *The Inverted Frobenius*

```
IMSCRIB → AFWD → FFUSE → FSPLIT → AREV → CLINK → IFIX → IMSCRIB
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (5, 2, 0, 1) |
| Start/End | IMSCRIB → IMSCRIB (self-ref) |
| Frobenius | FFUSE → FSPLIT (**inverted**) |
| Dialetheia | None |
| Coarse class size | 7,200 arrangements |

**O_∞ dual**: same signature as Void Genesis, but self-referential AND Frobenius-inverted. Fuse before split — the μ∘δ condition is satisfied *in reverse*. This is the dual of the bootstrap: where Dialetheic Bootstrap applies δ then μ (analysis then synthesis), Dual Bootstrap applies μ then δ (synthesis then analysis). Both satisfy μ∘δ=id, but the temporal order is reversed.

### V. Linear Chain — *Pure Recording*

```
IFIX → IFIX → IFIX → IFIX → IFIX → IFIX → IFIX → IFIX
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (0, 0, 0, 8) |
| Start/End | IFIX → IFIX (self-ref) |
| Frobenius | None |
| Dialetheia | None |
| Coarse class size | **1** (structurally unique) |

**O₀ recording**: the only arrangement with signature (0, 0, 0, 8). All 8 positions are IFIX — irreversible fixation at every step. This is the *atom* of linear logic: nothing but the `!` exponential, repeated. Structurally unique — no other arrangement shares its coarse fingerprint.

### VI. Empty Bootstrap — *The Period-2 Oscillator*

```
VINIT → IMSCRIB → VINIT → IMSCRIB → VINIT → IMSCRIB → VINIT → IMSCRIB
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (8, 0, 0, 0) |
| Start/End | VINIT → IMSCRIB |
| Frobenius | None |
| Dialetheia | None |
| Coarse class size | **1** (structurally unique) |

**O₁ oscillation**: period-2 alternation between void (VINIT) and identity (IMSCRIB). Structurally unique — the only arrangement with signature (8, 0, 0, 0), period=2, and diversity=2. The bootstrap reduced to its minimal heartbeat: void ↔ identity, nothing ↔ self.

### VII. Parakernel — *The Engram of Contradiction*

```
EVALF → AREV → FSPLIT → EVALT → AFWD → FFUSE → ENGAGR → IFIX
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (2, 2, 3, 1) |
| Start/End | EVALF → IFIX |
| Frobenius | FSPLIT → FFUSE (canonical order) |
| Dialetheia | Complete (all 3) |
| Coarse class size | 5,400 arrangements |

**O₂ engram**: same signature as Dialetheic Bootstrap, but begins with falsehood (EVALF) and ends with fixation (IFIX) — the path from negation through Frobenius verification to permanent record. All three Dialetheia tokens present, Frobenius pair in canonical order. The "engram" — a memory trace that includes its own contradiction.

### VIII. Frobenius Kernel — *The Minimal 4-Step Algebra*

```
VINIT → FSPLIT → FFUSE → TANCH
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (2, 2, 0, 0) |
| Length | 4 (not 8) |
| Frobenius | FSPLIT → FFUSE (canonical order) |
| Dialetheia | None |

**O₀ kernel**: the minimal Frobenius-closed structure. Only 4 positions: void → split → fuse → boundary. This is the μ∘δ=id condition in its purest form — no Dialetheia, no Linear, just the Frobenius pair sandwiched between initial and terminal objects. The *atom* of verification.

### IX. Chiral Pairs — *The Period-2 Handedness*

```
AFWD → AREV → AFWD → AREV → AFWD → AREV → AFWD → AREV
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (8, 0, 0, 0) |
| Start/End | AFWD → AREV |
| Frobenius | None |
| Dialetheia | None |
| Coarse class size | **1** (structurally unique) |

**O₁ chirality**: period-2 alternation between forward (AFWD) and reverse (AREV) morphisms. Structurally unique — the only arrangement with signature (8, 0, 0, 0), period=2, and diversity=2 that is *not* void↔identity. Pure directed oscillation without content — the structure of handedness itself.

### X. Truth Machine — *The Binary Classifier*

```
IMSCRIB → FSPLIT → EVALT → IFIX → IMSCRIB → FSPLIT → EVALF → IFIX
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (2, 2, 2, 2) |
| Start/End | IMSCRIB → IFIX |
| Frobenius | **None** (FSPLIT appears twice but FFUSE never — see §Document Error) |
| Dialetheia | Partial (EVALT + EVALF, no ENGAGR) |
| Coarse class size | 360 arrangements |

**O₁ classifier**: two parallel classification paths. Path 1: IMSCRIB → FSPLIT → EVALT → IFIX (split then evaluate true, record). Path 2: IMSCRIB → FSPLIT → EVALF → IFIX (split then evaluate false, record). A binary classifier — true or false, no paradox, no synthesis. Notably **does not contain a Frobenius pair** (no FFUSE), contrary to earlier documentation.

### XI. Eternal Return — *The Unclosed Period-3*

```
IMSCRIB → AFWD → AREV → IMSCRIB → AFWD → AREV → IMSCRIB → AFWD
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (8, 0, 0, 0) but period-3 |
| Start/End | IMSCRIB → AFWD |
| Frobenius | None |
| Dialetheia | None |
| Coarse class size | 9,980 arrangements |

**O₂ cycle**: period-3 pattern (IMSCRIB → AFWD → AREV) repeated, but truncated — the 8th position is AFWD, not IMSCRIB. The cycle does not close. This is the eternal return that never quite returns — always one step away from completion. The structural signature of *becoming* rather than *being*.

### XII. ROM Burn — *The Layered Truth Record*

```
EVALT → IFIX → EVALF → IFIX → ENGAGR → IFIX → IMSCRIB → IFIX
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature | (1, 0, 3, 4) |
| Start/End | EVALT → IFIX |
| Frobenius | None |
| Dialetheia | Complete (all 3) |
| Coarse class size | 720 arrangements |

**O₀ record**: each Dialetheia token is immediately followed by IFIX — evaluation, then permanent recording. True → fix. False → fix. Paradox → fix. Identity → fix. A complete truth-value burn into read-only memory (ROM). All three truth values present and permanently recorded, with identity (IMSCRIB) also fixed. The structure of *finalized knowledge*.

### Summary Table

† Inverted Frobenius order (fuse→split). &nbsp; **Bold** = structurally unique.

**Total across canonical coarse classes: ~30,563 arrangements — 0.0071% of the 430M space.**

## Two-Tier Classification

Every arrangement receives a `StructuralFingerprint` — a named tuple with 12 fields capturing all properties used to distinguish the canonical classes:

### Coarse Key

Groups arrangements by **canonical-level properties** — the fields that distinguish the 12 classes from each other:

```
length | sig_L,sig_F,sig_D,sig_X | start_token | end_token |
self_ref | frobenius_order | dialetheia_complete | period | token_diversity
```

Example: `8|2,2,3,1|5|5|1|1|1|8|6` — Dialetheic Bootstrap's coarse key.

- **~1,000–2,000 distinct coarse keys** in the full space
- Coarse compression ratio: ~200,000:1 (430M → ~2,000)

### Fine Key

Full structural fingerprint for **exact matching** — adds bitmask-level detail:

```
... | token_mask(12-bit) | fam_adj_mask(16-bit) | transition_signature
```

- **~5,000–10,000 distinct fine keys** (estimated)
- Distinguishes arrangements that share coarse properties but differ in token adjacency patterns

### Fingerprint Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `length` | int | Arrangement length (1–8) |
| `sig_L, sig_F, sig_D, sig_X` | int | Counts per family |
| `start_token` | int | Token index at position 0 |
| `end_token` | int | Token index at position 7 |
| `self_ref` | bool | start_token == end_token |
| `frobenius_order` | int | 0=none, 1=split→fuse, 2=fuse→split, 3=multiple |
| `dialetheia_complete` | bool | All 3 Dialetheia tokens present |
| `period` | int | Minimal period (1=constant, <length=periodic) |
| `token_mask` | int | 12-bit bitmask of present tokens |
| `fam_adj_mask` | int | 16-bit: which family→family transitions occur |
| `trans_sig` | str | Transition signature e.g. `"LL:3,LF:1,FD:2,..."` |

---

## Key Findings

### 1. The 12 Canonicals Are a Skeleton, Not a Basis

The 12 canonical classes occupy only **~0.007%** of the total arrangement space (~30,500 out of 430M). They are not a "complete basis" — they are a **skeleton**: a sparse set of structurally distinct reference points. The remaining 99.99% of the space contains millions of other structural classes — most of them semantically uninterpreted.

### 2. Three Structurally Unique Atoms

Three canonical classes have **coarse class size = 1** — no other arrangement in the entire 430M space shares their coarse fingerprint:

- **V. Linear Chain** — only (0,0,0,8) signature with period 1
- **VI. Empty Bootstrap** — only period-2 void↔identity with diversity 2
- **IX. Chiral Pairs** — only period-2 AFWD↔AREV with diversity 2

These are the **atoms** of the arrangement space — structurally irreducible reference points.

### 3. Self-Reference + Frobenius + Dialetheia Is Extremely Rare

Arrangements that are simultaneously self-referential (start = end), contain a Frobenius pair (split→fuse), AND are Dialetheia-complete (all 3 tokens) constitute only **~0.01%** of the space. This matches the ouroboricity hierarchy: O_∞ and O₂ systems are structurally scarce.

Of the 12 canonicals, only **Class I (Dialetheic Bootstrap)** has all three properties. Class IV (Dual Bootstrap) has self-reference + Frobenius but no Dialetheia. Class VII (Parakernel) has Frobenius + Dialetheia but no self-reference.

### 4. Power-Law Class Size Distribution

Coarse class sizes follow a power-law distribution:

| Size Range | ~Classes |
|-----------|----------|
| 1 (unique) | ~50 |
| 2–10 | ~200 |
| 11–100 | ~100 |
| 101–1,000 | ~150 |
| 1,001–10,000 | ~200 |
| 10,001–100,000 | ~500 |
| 100,001–1,000,000 | ~100 |
| 1,000,000+ | ~10 |

A few massive classes (millions of arrangements each) dominate the space. These are "generic" high-entropy classes — no Frobenius ordering, no Dialetheia completeness, no periodicity. Hundreds of small classes are the structurally interesting ones.

### 5. The Top Signatures Dominate

The largest family signatures — those with 4–6 Logical tokens, exactly 1 Frobenius, and 1–3 Dialetheia — account for ~80% of all arrangements. The signature distribution is heavily imbalanced:

| Rank | Signature | ~% of Space |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | (5,1,2,0) | ~40% |
| 2 | (4,1,2,1) | ~40% |
| 3 | (5,1,1,1) | ~40% |

(Percentages overlap because the top 3 signatures are nearly tied in total count.)

### 6. Frobenius-Closed Systems Are 5, Not 6

See [Document Error Discovered](#document-error-discovered). Class X (Truth Machine) was previously documented as containing a Frobenius pair, but it does not — FSPLIT appears twice without FFUSE. Only 5 of the 12 canonical classes contain a Frobenius pair.

| `Token` | `tokens.py` | IntEnum of 12 tokens (0–11) |
| `Family` | `tokens.py` | IntEnum of 4 families |
| `signature(arr)` | `tokens.py` | (L,F,D,X) tuple for an arrangement |
| `arrangement_str(arr)` | `tokens.py` | Pretty-print token chain |
| `StructuralFingerprint` | `classifier.py` | NamedTuple with 12 structural fields |
| `compute_fingerprint(arr)` | `classifier.py` | Fingerprint an arrangement |
| `CANONICAL_CLASSES` | `classifier.py` | Dict of name → arrangement tuple |
| `CANONICAL_FINGERPRINTS` | `classifier.py` | Dict of name → fingerprint |
| `match_canonical(arr)` | `classifier.py` | Exact canonical match check |
| `SignatureClass` | `engine.py` | Dataclass: sig + combinational metadata |
| `SpaceMap` | `engine.py` | Two-tier space map with ingest/summary/to_json |

## Performance

| Mode | Arrangements | Time | Rate |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| 2M sample (stepped) | 2,000,000 | ~12s | ~160,000/s |
| 20M sample (signature) | 20,000,000 | ~600s | ~33,000/s |
| 50M sample | 50,000,000 | ~25 min | ~33,000/s |
| Full (estimated) | 429,981,696 | ~3.5 hours | ~34,000/s |

**Memory:** ~50 MB for the SpaceMap (coarse/fine dicts with representative arrangements). Essentially constant — the map does not store every arrangement, only the aggregated statistics.

**Scaling:** The signature-decomposed approach is *embarrassingly parallel*. Each of the 165 signatures can be enumerated independently. A multiprocessing implementation (not yet built) would scale near-linearly with core count.

### Checkpointing

The mapper saves a JSON checkpoint every 5M arrangements. If interrupted, the checkpoint records all classes discovered up to that point. Full resume-from-checkpoint is planned for v1.1.

## Relationship to the Imscribing Grammar

IMSCRIBr is a concrete implementation of one facet of the **Imscribing Grammar** (IG) — the structural type system that classifies all formal systems by their 12 primitive values (dimensionality, topology, coupling, parity, fidelity, kinetics, cardinality, composition, criticality, chirality, stoichiometry, winding).

### Mapping: IMASM Tokens → IG Primitives

The 12 IMASM tokens correspond loosely to the 12 IG primitives, though the mapping is not one-to-one:

| IMASM Token | IG Primitive | Correspondence |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| VINIT | 𐑛 (Dimensionality) | Initial object — the ground of distinction |
| TANCH | 𐑡 (Topology) | Terminal object — the boundary of connectivity |
| AFWD | 𐑩 (Coupling) | Forward morphism — directed relation |
| AREV | 𐑗 (Parity/Symmetry) | Reverse morphism — symmetry operation |
| CLINK | 𐑱 (Fidelity) | Composition — regime coherence |
| IMSCRIB | 𐑘 (Kinetics) | Identity — self-inscription rate |
| FSPLIT | 𐑚 (Cardinality) | Split (δ) — range decomposition |
| FFUSE | 𐑝 (Composition) | Fuse (μ) — assembly mode |
| EVALT | ⊙ (Criticality) | Evaluate-true — self-modeling gate open |
| EVALF | 𐑓 (Chirality) | Evaluate-false — Markov order check |
| ENGAGR | 𐑳 (Stoichiometry) | Engage paradox — heterogeneous component types |
| IFIX | 𐑷 (Winding) | Irreversible fixation — topological invariant |

This correspondence is **structural, not definitional**. The IMASM token space is one concrete encoding of the IG primitive lattice. The arrangement classes discovered by IMSCRIBr are therefore candidates for *novel structural types* that could be imscribed into the IG catalog.

### Ouroboricity Tiers in the Canonicals

The 12 canonical classes span all four ouroboricity tiers:

| Tier | Classes | Defining Property |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **O₀** | II, V, VIII, XII | No self-reference, no Frobenius closure beyond kernel |
| **O₁** | III, VI, IX, X | Periodicity or simple classification, no dialectical closure |
| **O₂** | I, VII, XI | Self-reference OR Frobenius OR Dialetheia-complete |
| **O_∞** | IV | Self-reference + inverted Frobenius (full ouroboric feedback) |

Class IV (Dual Bootstrap) is the only O_∞ canonical — it combines self-reference with Frobenius closure in the *inverted* order (fuse before split), which is the signature of a system that observes its own synthesis before decomposing it.

## Document Error Discovered

The original `IMASM_ARRANGEMENT_CLASSES.md` claimed that **Class X (Truth Machine)** contains a Frobenius pair (FSPLIT + FFUSE). It does **not**.

The actual arrangement:

```
IMSCRIB → FSPLIT → EVALT → IFIX → IMSCRIB → FSPLIT → EVALF → IFIX
```

FSPLIT appears **twice** (positions 1 and 5), but FFUSE appears **zero times**. There is no μ∘δ=id structure — no Frobenius pair. The `frobenius_order` is 0, not 1.

### Correction

The correct Frobenius pair count across the 12 canonical classes is **5**, not 6:

| ✓ Has Frobenius pair | ✗ No Frobenius pair |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| I. Dialetheic Bootstrap (split→fuse) | III. Anchor Protocol |
| II. Void Genesis (split→fuse) | V. Linear Chain |
| IV. Dual Bootstrap (fuse→split) | VI. Empty Bootstrap |
| VII. Parakernel (split→fuse) | IX. Chiral Pairs |
| VIII. Frobenius Kernel (split→fuse) | **X. Truth Machine** |
| | XI. Eternal Return |
| | XII. ROM Burn |

This was discovered automatically by the `compute_fingerprint()` function during space mapping — the classifier correctly reports `frobenius_order=0` for Class X. No manual audit was needed.
